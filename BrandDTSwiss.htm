<h3>SPOKE MANUFACTURING</h3>
<p>Quality is achieved through experience and know how.&nbsp;Product development at DT Swiss focuses on new trends, technical innovation and very high quality standards</p>
<p><strong>STRAIGHTENING PROCESS</strong>:&nbsp;Wire from large reels is fed through a machine where it is straightened and cut to length.&nbsp;Only the highest quality 18/10 stainless steel is used.</p>
<p><strong>COLD FORGING</strong>:&nbsp;This process, which was developed and patented by DT Swiss, is used to double-butt the diameter of the spokes.</p>
<p><strong>SHAPING OF HEAD AND THREAD</strong>:&nbsp;Classic spokes are subsequently elbowed in a 90 &ndash; 95&ordm; angle, which gives them their typical J-shape. The other end of the spoke is rolled to a thread. Rolling provides additional material strength at the thread.</p>
<p><strong>FLAT FORGING</strong>:&nbsp;The source material which are bladed during this process with a weight of up to 250 tons. <br />This additional forging process densifies the material even more, which in turn achieves a greater strength at a lower weight.</p>
<p><strong>QUALITY CONTROL</strong>:&nbsp;Quality control starts with the inspection of incoming certified raw material and continues throughout the whole production process.</p>

<h3>WHEEL and HUBS</h3>
<p><strong>RATCHET SYSTEM&reg;</strong>:&nbsp;Thanks to the proven DT Swiss Ratchet System&reg; the hubs can easily be converted to different axle standards and rotors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CLASSIC TECHNOLOGY</strong> WITH&nbsp;HIGH END COMPONENTS:&nbsp;Hubs, spokes, nipples and rims all meet some of the tightest tolerances in the bicycle industry.</p>
<p><strong>INTERCHANGEABILITY</strong>:&nbsp;The conventional build of all CLASSIC wheels allows one to easily find and install spare parts, even in remote corners of the world.</p>
<p><strong>ADAPTED RIMS</strong>:&nbsp;CLASSIC wheels come with rims specifically designed for their intended use and aluminium versions are tubeless convertible.</p>
<p><strong>BEST VALUE</strong>: &nbsp;CLASSIC wheels offer the best value for the money. Simple wheel building and conventional componentry keep the cost low while featuring championship winning performance.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SPLINE ONE TECHNOLGY</strong></span> <br />Offering maximum performance and durability, each series of wheels features wider rim widths, multiple wheel sizes, easy tubeless setup, forged straight pull hubs and the legendary DT Swiss Ratchet System&reg; internals</p>
<p><strong>NEW RIM PROFILE</strong>: wider and lighter</p>
<p><strong>INVISIBLE RIM CONNECTION:</strong>&nbsp;The rims are finished using a special welding process that looks nearly seamless, but still allows for a tenacious bond. On the surface, all rims are coated with a special anodizing treatment that boosts strength and remains durable during use</p>
<p><strong>TUBELESS READY</strong>:&nbsp;All SPLINE ONE wheels are designed to be tubeless ready with the use of our tubeless rim tape. The rims have been carefully engineered to feature a profile that minimizes the forces applied on the rim sidewall.</p>
<p><strong>PRO HEAD&reg; REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM (PHR SYSTEM)</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, this system allows for consistency throughout the build process, easy wheel truing and reduced spoke breakage</p>
<p><strong>DT SQUORX NIPPLE</strong>:&nbsp;The newly developed Squorx nipple (short for Square-Torx nipple), is a part of the&nbsp;Pro Head&reg; Reinforcement System and provides a precise fit between the nipple and wrench.</p>
<p><strong>STRAIGHT PULL SPOKES</strong>:&nbsp;In order to achieve the ideal balance between light weight and stiffness, high-quality butted and forged stainless steel</p>
<p><strong>TWO-PIECE HUB BODY</strong>: The end result is a hub shell that appears seamless in nature and special in design.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MODULAR DESIGN HUB</strong>:&nbsp;SPLINE ONE wheels showcase DT Swiss&rsquo;s modular hub system, allowing the user to adapt to different axle and frame standards through a simple tool-free end cap swap. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DICUT&reg; TECHNOLOGY</strong></span></p>
<p>The RRC DICUT&reg; wheel line up is a perfect blend of aerodynamics, technology and design. Their aggressive optics push the rider on the climbs. DICUT&reg; hubs with their fine tuned flange geometry and straight pull spokes provide the stiffness needed. High modulus braking surfaces bonded with a heat resistant resin easily handle all descents. Dedicated carbon layers improve heat dissipation from the braking surface into the whole rim.</p>
<p><strong>MAXIMIZED FLANGE DISTANCE</strong>:&nbsp;Thanks to the high precision covers which integrate the rotor seal, the distance of the hub flanges can be maximized. This significantly increases the wheel's side-toside stiffness. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DICUT&reg; HUB</strong>:&nbsp;The potential of the systemwheel fully used: The hub is designed to perfectly match the proprietary straight Nail Head spokes, achieving an ideal relation between strength and lightweight</p>
<p><strong>NAIL HEAD SPOKES</strong>:&nbsp;Due to the specific shape of the straight spoke and the hub contact area, the spokes cannot twist under load or while truing, always keeping their perfect aerodynamic orientation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRICON&reg; TECHNOLOGY</span></strong></p>
<p>Features like the Open Crowfoot lacing and concave tubeless rims combine stiffness and lightweight into a superb wheel.</p>
<p><strong>STRAIGHT DOUBLE THREADED SPOKES</strong>:&nbsp;This spoke connection is considerably stronger as it is playfree on both ends and therefore subject to smaller peak loads.</p>
<p><strong>OPEN CROWFOOT</strong>:&nbsp;Spoke pattern with combined radial and crossed spokes for high stiffness and perfect transmission of torques.</p>
<p><strong>TORX NIPPLES</strong>:&nbsp;Thanks to the Torx design the truing tool has a better grip on the nipple.</p>
<p><strong>RIM INSERT</strong>:&nbsp;The spoke inserts are supported on two sides in the rim creating a big contact surface. The rim can be designed lighter and is airtight for tubeless compatibility. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONCAVE RIM PROFILE</strong>:&nbsp;The concave shaped sidewalls counteract the expansion force induced by tire pressure and spoke pull.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SUSPENSION TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p><strong>TWO-IN-ONE REMOTE LEVER</strong>: it is extremely light and enables simultaneous fork and shock control from the handlebar.</p>
<p><strong>OPM TECHNOLOGY</strong>:&nbsp;The totally new <strong>One Piece Mag</strong> lower is a high tech, injection-molded, magnesium piece of engineering.</p>
<p><strong>O.L TECHNOLOGY (OPEN - LOCK)</strong>:&nbsp;DT Swiss' proven, reliable and lightweight damping system O.L lets you choose between two riding modes: The super smooth Open Mode for rough trails or the Lockout Mode for paved surfaces and sprinting.</p>
<p><strong>O.D.L TECHNOLOGY (OPEN-DRIVE-LOCK)</strong>:&nbsp;A simple tool to adapt your suspension setup to any situation. It features a super smooth Open Mode for rough trails, a sportier Drive Mode for perfect efficiency on climbs and on smoother terrain as well as a Lockout Mode for paved surfaces and sprinting.</p>
