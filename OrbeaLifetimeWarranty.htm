<p>Orbea provides a lifetime guarantee on all its frames. Only a brand that knows the materials, masters the technologies and has the skills can guarantee your frame to be totally reliable.Only Orbea takes you a step beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Orbea monocoque construction will ensure you have no frame problems. And if you do, if your frame has a manufacturing defect, whenever that might happen,&nbsp;we will respond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating an Orbea frame involves a long time spent working on design, manufacture and quality testing before it reaches you. Orbea constant effort to ensure&nbsp;their bicycles are of the highest possible quality allows&nbsp;them to offer you this guarantee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The guarantee is activated using the registration number you will find on all Orbea frames. When you have activated it at your dealer&rsquo;s or at <a href="http://www.orbea.com/int-en/access-register" target="_blank">www.orbea.com</a>, your bike will automatically receive its lifetime guarantee. But that&rsquo;s not all: there are many more advantages to registering with Orbea such as being able to report it if it&rsquo;s stolen and taking part in competitions or accessing the latest news, and basically everything that&rsquo;s going on at Orbea.</p>
