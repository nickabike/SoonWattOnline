<strong>THE BEGINNING</strong> <br /><br />
<p><strong>The company-history has its beginning in the year 1634</strong>.<br /> At this time a physicist named Scharandi from Solothurn started drawing wire in the Taubenlochschlucht in Biel. Over the decades and centuries the craft was developed and industrialized.<br /><br /> <strong>1934</strong><br /> At the beginning of the 20st century the first bicycle components were produced in Biel. In the year 1934 the products ranged from spokes and rims to dust shields for bicycles and pushchairs.<br /><br /><strong>THE HISTORY OF THE NEW COMPANY 1994</strong><br /> DT Swiss AG was founded by a management buyout from the United Wireworks by the current owners Frank B&ouml;ckmann, Maurizio D&rsquo;Alberto and Marco Zingg. The short-name DT was created by the former company with the german/french name &ldquo;Vereinigte Drahtwerke / Tr&eacute;fileries r&eacute;unie&rdquo; (means United Wireworks) and is still today an important part of the company name. The D stands for Drahtwerke and the T for Tr&eacute;fileries. With the management-buyout the company was renamed into to DT Swiss. The new name reflects the origins of the company and stands for Swiss tradition and high quality.<br /> The production of spokes was once the beginning of the company. Already before the founding of DT Swiss AG, DT became synonymous for high quality Swiss spokes and stands until today for durability and preciseness.</p>
