<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The Good Design Awards, the oldest and most prestigious of their kind, are chosen annually by the Chicago Athenaeum, in cooperation with the European Centre for Architecture, Art, Design and Urban Studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">With entries designed and manufactured in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, the contest is very competitive. Even so, Orbea was remarkably superior to its rivals this year too.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The company had submitted the Orbea Grow, to compete in the Children&rsquo;s Products category. The Grow range of children&rsquo;s products comprises three bike models that can be adjusted and grow bigger as kids get older.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">This concept, which had received the Delta de Oro award in Spain, aims at being ecologically responsible. Since the Grow can be adjusted in size, it lasts longer, which means it&rsquo;s not disposed of soon, thus reducing waste. The Grow 0 offers kids the chance to acquire the dynamic balance they need to ride a bike. With this bike&rsquo;s ergonomic frame design, little riders can push themselves up to speed and lift their feet to coast. The Orbea Grow 0 is the ideal bike for kids aged 2-4.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The Grow 1 and 2 can be your child&rsquo;s first bike. These bikes feature a compact and lightweight aluminum frame, like those in our aluminum bikes for adults. Not only can the Grow seat and handlebar be raised, but the frame also extends to allow a growing child many years of use. Grow 1 is for kids aged 3-5.5 and Grow 2, for small riders aged 5-9.</span></p>
