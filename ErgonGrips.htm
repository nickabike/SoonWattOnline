<p>Ergon's product development team doesn't only focus on Ergonomicsmaterial research is also a core theme. The demands and testing ourproducts undergo meet those of the automotive industry, and far exceed theindustry standard. Ergonomics, Product Design and Engineering - everythingis done in-house in Germany. It is from this that successful projects havebeen born, such as our GreenLab initiative, which explores the use ofsustainable materials. For 2011 we quietly introduced what is a majormilestone in our development. All grips in the Performance Comfort Serieswere switched to a new rubber compound. As part of this process 39 rubbercompounds were developed and tested. It was worth it, the new material- made in Germany - meets the highest standards, is longer lasting andworldwide is exclusive to Ergon for the bicycle industry.</p>
