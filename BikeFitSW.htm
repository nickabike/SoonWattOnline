<h4><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>What is Bike Fitting?</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Bike fitting is a process to explore and determine the relationship of the 3 points of contact between the rider and his/her bicycle.&nbsp; The 3 points of contact are saddle, pedal and handle grip whereby their settings will determine the riding posture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Bicycle manufacturers produce frames based on their own design concept and geometry studies, a size 54cm from two different brands may differ in tubes length and angle.&nbsp; Frames are also made in different sizes to carter to the mass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Since they are made differently, choosing of the right size and using the right setting of stem, handlebar and seat post will be essential for riders to achieve comfortable rides, performance and to reduce the risk of developing long term sports related injuries.&nbsp; Bicycles should always be setup to suit the rider and not the other way around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In addition, the human body is complex.&nbsp; Every riders will have a different level of flexibility, lifestyle, riding purpose and preferences , age and some may even have medical issues.&nbsp; The setup of the equipment can thus be different even when riders having the same physique.&nbsp; This is especially so when one is younger, healthier, more flexible and highly competitive.</span></p>
